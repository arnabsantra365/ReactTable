This project is done by the help of Material React Table(MRT) and Tanstack Table.

Tasks Achieved
->Tabular.js contains the structure of MRT table that is passed to App.js. 
->Sidebar.js contains the ON click filter options that would display the filtering modes differently and not below the header of columns .
->Various features like drag and drop are implemented for grouping tthe items.
->Hide and Show columns is aslo implemented using a different button.
->Searching and Sorting has also been implemented.
->Dates are fixed using moment.js.

Issues

->Couldn't implement the sidebar functionality fully due to time constraints.
->The sales price has some null valus which couldn't be dealt with for filter faeceted values.
